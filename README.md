# Geotiff Lab

Test project to get help troubleshooting GeoTiff [0,0] data return.

When using the `example.tif` COG files from the OpenLayers examples. The COG is added and rendered as expected. When using our own GeoTiff, no data is rendered correctly and hovering reveals the GeoTiff layer is returning data: `Uint8Array [ 0, 0 ]`



Uses OpenLayers version: `9.0.0`
